`json-server` watches a JSON file and exposes it as a REST API. It is a popular
choice for quick prototyping, tutorials, and front-end work that needs a
realistic backend without writing one.

## How it works

Provide a `db.json` file describing your resources:

```json
{
  "posts": [{ "id": 1, "title": "Hello" }],
  "comments": [{ "id": 1, "body": "Nice", "postId": 1 }]
}
```

Then run `json-server db.json` and fetch from `http://localhost:3000/posts`.
