`astro-content-hub` is a content-hub template: it aggregates documentation
and blog posts from many open-source repositories into one **localized,
auto-deployed static site**. Content ships through pull requests, so nothing
lands on main without review.

## Why this template

The hard parts of a content hub — i18n with per-page fallback, typed content
collections, data-driven product routes, and free deployment — are already
solved. You write Markdown; the hub builds and deploys.

## What you get

- **Hub + content-sync model** — one hub, many source repos, PR-based review.
- **i18n with per-page fallback** — `en` at root, `zh-Hans` under `/zh-Hans/`,
  never a 404 on a missing translation.
- **Data-driven products** — add an entry to `site.config.ts`, and the landing,
  docs routes, and sidebar appear automatically.
- **Zero-config styling** — one global stylesheet on CSS custom properties,
  shared `.prose` typography, dark mode.
- **SEO & discoverability** — canonical URLs, sitemap, RSS, `llms.txt`,
  `robots.txt`, custom 404.
- **Reading UX** — docs TOC, prev/next pagination, copy-code buttons, tag
  pages, related posts, breadcrumbs.
- **Free auto-deploy** — a manual workflow publishes to GitHub Pages and
  Cloudflare Pages at no cost.
